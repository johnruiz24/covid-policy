This is a Final Project for the subject of Data Visualization, this is part of a project where we created a dashboard to monitor covid-19 information, cases, deaths, vaccinations and policies implemented. This project was created by Filipe Dias, Mariana Byrne, John Ruiz, Zhenghao Li. 

This dashboard is split into different tabs because we had some memory problems with the implementation in Heroku, so there are two dashboards linked together to make the app work.
